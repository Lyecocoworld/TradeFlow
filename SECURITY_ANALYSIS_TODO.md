- [x] Await user to deploy the updated plugin, reproduce the issue, and provide the server console logs.
- [x] Analyze the provided logs, specifically focusing on `[FINEST]` messages from `Shop.isUnlocked`, `Database.areMapsReady()`, and `Database.hasPlayerCollected()`, and the new GUI messages for locked items.
- [x] Determine the exact values of `setting.getSetting()` for the problematic item and the return values of `Database.get().areMapsReady()` and `Database.get().hasPlayerCollected()` from the logs.
- [ ] Pinpoint whether the "pas la permission" message is directly caused by the `isUnlocked` method's return value or by another access control mechanism.
- [ ] Based on log analysis, implement the correct, non-placeholder logic for `areMapsReady()` and `hasPlayerCollected()` (if necessary), or further debug and correct the `CollectFirst` initialization and usage logic.
